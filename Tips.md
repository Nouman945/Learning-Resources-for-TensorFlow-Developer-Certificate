### Sec 5. Computer Vision

**NOTE:** Many Machine learning models and neural networks prefer the values of the data between 0 and 1. Knowing this, one of the most common preprocessing steps for working with images is to scale(also called normalization) by dividing there values by .255 ( Since 255 is the maximum pixel value )

- Always try to normalize the the data
  - Divide the image data with .255 to get them in 0-1 range
